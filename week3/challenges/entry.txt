Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. \
Be yourself; everyone else is already taken. \
A room without books is like a body without a soul. \
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough. \
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything. \
Without music, life would be a mistake. \
Insanity is doing the same thing, over and over again, but expecting different results. \
Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans. \
A woman is like a tea bag; you never know how strong it is until it's in hot water. \
Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.
