code repository:

cvcs = centralized version control system:
the entire code base lives in only one place
prevelant when dealing with enterprise or anything that is risk averse. Supported by Murcurial, Perforce, TFS.
One lane road

dvcs = distributed ... :
the code base is on any machine that is a part of that codebase network. 
All of the machines have a good portion of the whole code but not everything. SVN, Git.
Mulit-lane road
Eventually bring all the branches together and we call that a merge

primary reason to use version control is to see the history of the code
